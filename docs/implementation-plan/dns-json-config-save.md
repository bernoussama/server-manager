# DNS JSON Config Save Implementation

## Branch Name
dns-json-config-save

## Background and Motivation
Currently, the DNS configuration system saves BIND-format configuration files (zone files, named.conf, named.conf.zones). The user has requested that when saving DNS config files, we should also save JSON versions of them in the same directory. This would provide:

1. **Human-readable configuration**: JSON files are easier to read and parse programmatically
2. **Configuration backup**: JSON versions can serve as a backup and reference
3. **API integration**: JSON format makes it easier to integrate with other systems
4. **Debugging and auditing**: JSON files provide a clear view of the configuration structure

The requirement is to save JSON versions alongside every DNS configuration file that gets written, maintaining the same directory structure.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **File naming convention**: Need to determine consistent naming for JSON versions (e.g., `example.com.zone` â†’ `example.com.zone.json`)
2. **Data structure**: Ensure JSON contains complete configuration data that corresponds to the BIND format
3. **Synchronization**: Ensure JSON files are always saved when BIND files are saved
4. **Error handling**: Handle cases where JSON writing fails but BIND file succeeds (or vice versa)
5. **Testing**: Need to verify that JSON files contain correct data and are properly formatted
6. **Performance**: Minimal impact on existing save operations

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. [ ] Create feature branch off `fix-backen-build` for dns-json-config-save
   - Success criteria: Branch created and ready for development
2. [ ] Create JSON helper functions for DNS configuration
   - Success criteria: Functions to convert DNS config objects to JSON format
3. [ ] Modify `writeFileWithBackup` to support JSON file writing
   - Success criteria: Function can write both BIND and JSON versions when requested
4. [ ] Update zone file generation to save JSON versions
   - Success criteria: Zone files have corresponding JSON files with zone data
5. [ ] Update named.conf generation to save JSON version
   - Success criteria: named.conf has corresponding JSON file with configuration
6. [ ] Update zone.conf generation to save JSON version
   - Success criteria: named.conf.zones has corresponding JSON file
7. [ ] Write unit tests for JSON file generation
   - Success criteria: Tests cover JSON content accuracy and file creation
8. [ ] Test integration with existing DNS configuration workflow
   - Success criteria: Existing functionality works without regression
9. [ ] Add error handling for JSON save failures
   - Success criteria: Graceful handling when JSON save fails
10. [ ] Document the JSON file feature
    - Success criteria: Documentation explains JSON file structure and location
