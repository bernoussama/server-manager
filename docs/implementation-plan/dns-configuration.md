# DNS Configuration Implementation

## Branch Name
dns-configuration-feature

## Background and Motivation
DNS configuration is a critical part of network service management. The goal is to implement a feature that allows users to manage DNS zones, records, and server settings through the application. This includes creating, updating, and deleting DNS zones and records, as well as configuring the DNS server.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- BIND DNS server configuration requires careful formatting of zone files
- Need to validate DNS record formats to prevent security issues and syntax errors
- Need to handle permissions for writing to system files
- Implementing proper error handling and validation for user inputs
- Testing DNS configuration without affecting production systems

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. ✓ Create feature branch off `main` for dns-configuration-feature
2. ✓ Develop DNS zone file generation logic
3. ✓ Write unit tests for DNS zone file generation
4. ✓ Implement DNS configuration API (GET and POST endpoints)
5. ✓ Implement DNS zone management API
6. ✓ Create UI for DNS configuration
7. ✓ Fix test issues related to DNS controller tests
   - Success criteria: All tests pass without errors
8. [ ] Complete integration tests for the DNS API endpoints
   - Success criteria: Tests cover happy path and error scenarios
9. [ ] Add validation for DNS configuration forms
   - Success criteria: Forms validate input before submission
10. [ ] Implement error handling and user feedback for DNS configuration updates
    - Success criteria: Users see clear messages on success/failure
11. [ ] Test the DNS configuration feature end-to-end
    - Success criteria: DNS zones can be created, updated, and deleted through the UI
12. [ ] Document DNS configuration feature
    - Success criteria: Documentation includes usage examples and error handling

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Fixed the issue in dnsController.test.ts where it was trying to mock the nonexistent logger.http method
- All DNS controller tests now pass successfully
- Ready to continue with integration tests for the DNS API endpoints

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- None

## Lessons Learned
- Properly mock only the methods that exist in the actual implementation
- Check logger implementation before mocking its methods in tests
