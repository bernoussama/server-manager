## Lessons Learned
- [2024-07-26] Parsing command outputs requires careful attention to potential variations and error states.
- [2024-07-26] For CPU usage, `/proc/stat` provides detailed counters. `os.loadavg()` is simpler for system load averages. The load average is not a direct CPU percentage but can be used to approximate it: `(loadavg[0] / cores) * 100` (capped at 100%).
- [2024-07-26] `systemctl` provides comprehensive service information on modern Linux systems. Using `--plain --no-legend` flags with `systemctl list-units` simplifies output parsing.
- [2024-07-26] The `uptime -p` command provides a user-friendly uptime string.
- [2024-07-26] The `free -m` command output needs careful parsing; splitting by `\s+` handles variable spacing.
- [2024-07-26] The `df -h` output parsing needs to account for potential spaces in filesystem names by joining initial parts and taking fixed-position elements from the end.
- [2024-07-26] When installing dependencies in a pnpm monorepo, use `pnpm add --filter <package-name> <dependency>` to target the correct workspace package.
- [2024-07-27] When mocking logger functions in tests, only mock methods that actually exist in the logger. Check the logger implementation before creating mocks to avoid "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors.
